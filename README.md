Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this most recent animal study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, was compared to the other treatment regimens. A technical report of the study was needed to form a top-level summary of the results.

The main Git repository code is found in jupyter notebook [maincode](Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals_main_code.ipynb) in folder Pharmaceuticals. Final Analysis/Observations are included at the top of this notebook.
